Service Contract - SessionMode.Required Service contracts must require sessions because this is how information will be shared between the coordinator (typically the client) and the participating services

Operation Behavior - TransactionScopeRequired=true. Operation
behavior must require a transaction scope. This will create a
new transaction if one is not already present.
Operation Contract - TransactionFlowOption.Allowed. Operation
contracts must allow transaction information to flow in the
header of messages.
Binding Definition - TransactionFlow = true. The binding must
enable transaction flow so that the channel can put transaction information
into the SOAP header. Also note that the binding must support
sessions because wsHttpBinding does but basicHttpBinding
does not.
Client - TransactionScope The party that initiates the transaction,
typically the client, must use a transaction scope when calling the
service operations. It must also call TransactionScope.Close,- to
commit the changes.
